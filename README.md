About this resource:
Scotus Speech is a collection of oral arguments that took place from 2010 to 2018. The conversations (arguments) are formal dialogues between attorneys (counsel) and justices about cases of interest to the United States.

Although the conversations follow some procedural rules and formalities, they are fairly straightforward and some are even interesting to listen to.

Scotus Speech is inspired by the (LibriSpeech)[http://www.openslr.org/12] project, which produced a free ASR corpus from Project Gutenberg audiobooks.

As all recordings and transcripts are in the public domain (see SCOTUS website)[https://www.supremecourt.gov/oral_arguments/availabilityoforalargumenttranscripts.aspx],the use cases are endless. Here are a few ideas:

- training & benchmarking automatic speech recognition (ASR) systems
- full-transcript search of SCOTUS oral arguments
- language model for legal dialogue
- academic study of SCOTUS conversations
